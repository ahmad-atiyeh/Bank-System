# Bank Management System in C++

This is a **console-based bank management system** written in **C++** that allows you to manage client information and perform basic banking transactions such as deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry. All client data is stored in a local text file (`clientsList.txt`).

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md       
```

## ðŸ§¾ clientsList.txt Format

Each client is stored in a single line in the following format:

```
AccountNumber#//#PinCode#//#FullName#//#Phone#//#Balance
```

Example:
```
12345#//#0000#//#John Doe#//#555-1234#//#2500.75
```

## Notes

- All client data is stored in a simple text file.
- Records are updated by rewriting the file (with logical deletion using a `mark` flag).
- The interface is entirely CLI-based with input validation and confirmation prompts.
